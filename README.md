Repo for codewars, leet code , hankerrank etc for C lang


## Requirements

For codewars, installed https://github.com/Snaipe/Criterion to run tests locally since codewars tests do not provide any output on failure.  I.e. sometimes my output would be correct locally but all sample tests but one would pass for some inexplicable reason.
